# News-Feed
The goal is to create a News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. This project uses Guardian API.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills to achieve : 

1. Connecting to an API
2. Parsing the response of the API
3. Handling error cases gracefully
4. Updating information regularly
5. Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
